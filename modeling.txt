HEAT DISSIPATION FROM 134.75 C, taking into account the "steam cooling" phase:
    3/(seconds / 300 + 0.1) + (104.71105103 - 0.01925291 * seconds)

APPROXIMATE HEAT DISSIPATION FROM 100 C:
    98.91401153 - 0.01933924 * seconds

DELAY FROM HEAT OFF AT 124.5 C TO TEMPERATURE DECREASING:
    6.974 sec
